# Streaks-CodeOrCreate-2020
Welcome to our game design submission for CodeOrCreate2020: On Thin Ice

Why we made this: We are a group of high schoolers that believe that not enough has been done to prevent climate change in our modern world. That's why we made a game that is a call to action. It's a text-based, "choose your own adventure" type game that follows the life of a polar bear as they try to adapt to a changing climate. Your goal is to live three full days without dying by making choices that will help the polar bear survive. Certain choices will have an RNG factor (which means that their outcome will sometimes be different) to simulate the fact that polar bears are facing great odds in their survival. Throughout the game, it's very likely that you'll make the wrong choices and end up dying. At the end of each type of death, there is a blurb that'll give you more information about how it affects polar bears and what you can do to help. There is also more incentive to learn about climate change and what you can after you beat the game. Hope you enjoy!

Notes and Thanks: Thanks to "Connected Lane County" for hosting this event and giving us the opportunity and the resources to work together to create this project! Also, we want to give a huge shoutout to Nikole Garcia who was our mentor during the CodeORCreate event. Without her, this game would not have been possible to finish. Thank you so much!
