# Streaks-CodeOrCreate-2020
Welcome to our game design submission: On Thin Ice

Why this was made: We are a group of high schoolers that believe that not enough has been done to prevent climate change in our modern world. That's why we made a game that is a call to action. It's about a text-based, "Choose your own adventure" type game that follows the life of a polar bear as they try to adapt to a changing climate. Your goal is to live three full days without dying and each Throughout the game, it's very likely that you'll make the wrong choices and end up dying. At the end of each type of death, there is a blurb about the type of death that'll give you more information about how it affects polar bears and what you can do to help. There is also more incentive to learn about climate change and what you can do at the end of the game. 

Software Used: Twine version 2.3.9 (Sugarcube 2.31.1)

Contributors: Brandon Cho, Victor Dossin, Faris Elzeyadi, Kenta Tsukamoto

Notes or thanks: Huge shoutout to Nikole Garcia who was our mentor during the CodeORCreate event. Without her, this game would not have been possible to finish. Thank you so much!
